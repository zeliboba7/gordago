	9|Attention!\nYou are try to export the strategy using indicators, which, possible, is absent in your MetaTrader4. If it is really so, it is necessary to export these indicators along with strategy, otherwise it will not work in MT. Put the marks opposite that indicator, which not there or can be not there. If you already exported these indicators, these marks are not needed. Nothing terrible if you put the mark on existing indicator - it simply copy anew. Do not forget about need of the compiling exported indicator by MetaEditor. When compiling indicator or expert advisor do not forget to do small change to code, for instance, put the "Space" in any place of the text (do not spoil code, however!) - otherwise they are will not compiled
